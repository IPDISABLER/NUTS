# NUTS

A Python script that utilizes a multitude of hacking utilities (via the [https://github.com/arismelachroinos/lscript](The Lazy Script) ) for massive attacks on singular targets.

## Installation
First, install this package, and it will install the lazy script for you, and you won't have to go through that installation. Then, it will ask you if you want to install some default tools from the lazy script. If you answer yes, you will be able to do lots of things from the start. But if you choose no, you will have to use the menus in the script to install the tools you need.
